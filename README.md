# Face_recognition
This program uses python,OpenCv package, an open-source package aimed at real-time computer vision applications. It works on Haar Cascade algorithm. 
Haar Cascade classifiers are an effective way for object detection. 
This method was proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features .
Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based approach where a lot of positive and negative images are used to train the classifier.
The webcam or camera captures the image and the face is detected.
